This morning I met with Lisa and Anna regarding a naming convention used in the navigation bar. They suggested replacing the 'education' category by titling it 'collective' instead.

Today I rehashed my high-school geometry skills (or lack-there-of) in order to mathematically define an equilateral triangle animation for the expose page. I want to define three points in the web page, one for each point of the triangle. These points must have a common center point and be equidistant from each other. The center point and the radius of the triangle are given. Solve for all three points in the triangle : p1, p2, and p3.

Given :

	const center_point = {x:0, y:0}
	const triangle_radius = 100

Determining the x,y coordinates of point 1 is simple, just assume it's directly above the center point so...

	let p1 = {x:null,y:null}

Given a radius, determine the side-length of the triangle with the following :

	let side_len = triangle_radius * (Math.sqrt(3))

Next, point your attention toward the inscribed circle. An inscribed circle is a circle inside of a triangle that has three points which happen to be the midpoints of the triangle sides. Anyway, we can find the radius of the inscribed circle with the following :
	
	let inscribed_circle_radius = (Math.sqrt(3)/6) * side_len
