Thanks for an excellent first day. I'll reach out to the two Android experts that I know and provide you with updates.

The following lines are used to 'map' the current layout of the foundry10.org website.

nav-bar
  areas               => foundry10.org/areas-overview/
    artistic design   => .../areas-overview/artistic-design/
    digital audio     => .../areas-overview/digital-audio/
    early education   => .../areas-overview/early-education/
    gender studies    => .../areas-overview/girls-programs/
    interships        => .../areas-overview/internships/
    robotocs          => .../areas-overview/robotics/
    automotive        => .../areas-overview/automotive/
    drama             => .../areas-overview/drama/
    games & learning  => .../areas-overview/games-and-learning/

TODO : now that I've mapped the nav bar, map each of the major pages including their links

foundry10.org = {

}

/research/ = {
  'lets collaborate' : '/contact-us/',
  /* this page contains links to the various research articles that have been produced by foundry10 */
}

/research-1/areas-of-interest = {
  'lets collaborate' : '/contact-us/'
  TODO - this page seems intended to demonstrate to viewers the primary areas of research. Using the collapsible style layout for this content seems a bit off. The /areas-overview/ page has a potential alternative style for this type of content to consider.
}

/contact-us/ = {
  'lets collaborate' : '/contact-us/' FIXME - recursive link, we're already navigated to the /contact-us/
}

Proposal Layout
  <nav-bar>
    /programs                     ul
    /programs/overview            li

    note, the following block represents routes that may exist but would not necessarily be linked to in the navbar
    /programs/overview/artistic-design
    /programs/overview/digital-audio
    /programs/overview/early-education
    /programs/overview/gender
    /programs/overview/robotics
    /programs/overview/automotive
    /programs/overview/drama
    /programs/overview/games-and-learning
    /programs/overview/hiphop
    /programs/overview/professional-developmen
    /programs/overview/virtual-reality

    /programs/internships         li
    /programs/apply               li

    /research

    /about-us                     ul
    /about-us/team                li
    /about-us/instructors         li
    /about-us/history             li
    /about-us/board-of-advisors   li
    /about-us/partners            li

    /contact-us
  </nav-bar>

  note, some of the content on the navbar of the site is traditionally placed in the footer
  making this change may improve the 'classic' quality of the site as well as allow the remaining elements left in the nav-bar to stand out and benefit from a greater emphasis.
  consider moving the careers link to the footer.
  <footer>
    /contact-us                   footer
    /careers                      footer

Description of Foundry10 from Tom Swanson
  let p1 = {
    on paper, we are a philanthropic research organization that studies learning, particularly in non-traditional settings or subjects. Our work generally falls into one of three categories: research, programs or outreach.  Our research is formal (complete with IRB approval) and with the intent to publish.  We have work published on spatial reasoning and long-term recall are affected by video game expertise, the impact of dance movement on student learning in early education programs, and how high school students from different countries react to different genders of authority figures.
  }

  let p2 = {
    Our programs have research components but are much more about exploration or applying a theory.  The best example of this is our VR program where we have donated HTC Vives (or other VR kits) and computers to over 40 schools around the world to see how the teachers use it, what makes for good content, and what the students themselves see as opportunities.
  }

  let p3 = {
    Finally, our "outreach" component is similar to a grant program, but is more about helping in-classroom teachers, who do not have access to resources, get what they need to carry out interesting ideas.  A good example of this is the Northshore Automotive Program where we funded an electric drag racer to be designed and built fully by high schoolers.  That car now holds some world records, here is the trailer to a documentary we made about the experience: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUleWXHaM3g.  You can check out our other videos too, they capture a lot of the programs we do.
  }

  let p4 = {
    Hopefully that gives you a feel for foundry10.  As far as fees go, everything we do is free for the schools, students, teachers, and communities with which we work.  The rare times we do charge is really only for events to cover venue fees and food.  Foundry10 is privately funded by a single investor, his name is Gabe Newell of Valve Software.  When we started, we were tasked with "doing interesting things with learning", and we took that to mean we should study it as much as we can.  We also put an emphasis on student and teacher voice, making sure that most, and ideally all, of the work we do starts at the ground level with ideas from students and teachers themselves.
