Three design alternatives :
  opensail.io
  opensail.io/square
  opensail.io/collapse

Work for today consisted primarily of creating an alternative module for displaying foundry10's organizational info. I created a expandible/collapsible module. The module is broken into three sections : tech, collective, and art.

Each of these categories has three sub categories : tech = [robotics, vr, game dev, automotive], collective = [internships, gender studies, early education, professional development], art = [artistic design, digital audio, drama, hip hop]

Add an event listener to each of the sub-category elements. On click event, expand the sub-category to display info/images related to the category AND collapse any other expanded sub categories.

For the categorical groups, they each have a color assigned to them. My initial idea was to assign to all 12 categories (3x supercategories * 4x sub-categories per super) some color from the orange spectrum. Tom suggested that I use the orange, green, and purple spectrums; so I made this modification.

I met with both the cyber-security group and with Andrun today.
  The cyber security group is doing exceedingly well. They have an excellent handle on javascript especially, which is allowing them great flexibility.

  Similarly, Andrun is doing very well on his project. I've seen considerable advancements in his work. He seems to be utilizing javascript libraries, however he would benefit greatly from setting aside time to learn the language more formally.
