Good morning! I've arrived at 8:25 am to the office this morning & Anna was punctual/kind enough to let me in.

Today I'm setting out to accomplish 4 goals.
    1. make the accordian post
    2. clean and document html, css, and javascript (the code is getting unwieldy in some places)
    3. minify the javascript used on the web page to optimize the user experience and reduce latency
    4. Modify the circle/triangular graphic to position it better on the landing page (I want to see desirable locations for the element on full, tablet, and mobile sizes)
