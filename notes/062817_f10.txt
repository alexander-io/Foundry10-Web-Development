Greetings! My notes for the day are included below.

Tom drafted three relevant questions to consider for site development moving forward.
  who are the users? what are they interested in given what's on our site?
  where are the confusions on our site?
  how to re-organize the nav bar to have greater utility?

Today we especially discussed the nav-bar layout and how one method of organizing it may be to provide a link/drop-down for each type of user. Where a user type may be a student, parent, teacher, researcher, or employee.

Currently, I have the nav-bar dev environment live at the following url.

I contacted Henry Woody, BoS Mathematics, who has experience with Android application development. His most recent application is called Eventi and it scored great popularity among the students of our school. I will introduce the two of you via email.
