Today's work consisted mainly of seeking feedback from co-workers (the creatives) on the recent implementations of elements for the site. I was able to spend time collaborating with Ethan and Tim.

Once major concern with the design I have is an abrupt transition from the "three-pillars" of foundry10 (research, programs, and outreach) to the section devoted to the subject areas. I am working to implement content to smoothe the transition between both of these sections. My idea was to further describe the significance of the three-pillars while demonstrating their relation to the subject-areas. In order to do this, I have expanded a section of space between these two sections and reserved it for the further explanation of the three-pillars and the demonstration of their relation to the subject areas.

I also had the awesome opportunity to work with the cyber security group on their venture. They are making considerable progress on their project. It was a win for me to see them launch a remote server, program the server side script for handling http requests, configure port forwarding on the server, execute the server side script to listen on port 8080 for requests, and access their site live on the internet. It's my opinion that J. from the cyber security group has an outstandingly high aptitude for computer science.
