Met with Tom this morning. He gave me an array of suggestions to improve the look & usability of the expose page.
  todo_lst = [
    'reduce drop shadow on bottom nav in info-banner',
    'standardize the buttons',
    'research elegant flame patterns to include on the site, or glass blowing/foundry elements',
    'font : helvetics nueue',
    'color scheme',
    'remove doubly layered nav-bar to opt for single (cry)',
    'footer',
    'include description of expose page'
  ]
