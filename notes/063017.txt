Today I set out to create a layout for the expose/about-us page that clearly and concisely describes the organization and their work.

I started today by gathering icons to represent the various on-going at foundry10. For example, I have now included icons in the project repository for a arist brush, camera aris, code-braces, gender-studies, game-controller, robotics, and a wrench. The icnons can be found at the following url :
