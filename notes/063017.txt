Today I set out to create a layout for the expose/about-us page that clearly and concisely describes the organization and their work.

I started today by gathering icons to represent the various on-going at foundry10. For example, I have now included icons in the project repository for a arist brush, camera aris, code-braces, gender-studies, game-controller, robotics, and a wrench. The icnons can be found at the following url :

In the development environment, I've added elements including icons, headers, links, text-bodies, and an image-banner. I've added code to ensure that the site stays mobile friendly.

This morning I submitted my weekly hours to Jenna. I met with Lisa regarding my experience at foundry10 as a web developer so far. Tom provided me with the server, and file-transfer-protocol credentials for the organization's server.
