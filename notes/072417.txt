Today Tom has tasked me with restructuring the development environment. He has requested that I move the circle graphic to the footer, move animated rotating queue text to footer, move the info-banner to center page, apply links to footer.

He mentioned that he is a fan of the vecotr images that I created. However, he would like to see more vector images so to find some that more closely correspond to the words research, programs, and outreach.
