Today is an abbreviated day in the office for me as I have a research meeting to attend in Tacoma in the mid-afternoon. Since Tom is out of office today at Ti7, I made sure to mention to Lisa that I would be leaving office earlier than usual toady.

This morning I'm devoting in part to reading articles related to custom css/javascript integration into wordpress. I found two seemingly related and useful links on this topic :
https://www.ostraining.com/blog/wordpress/custom-js/
and
https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/including-css-javascript/

  can add custom javascript to a wordpress site via a WordPress plugin called "Header and Footer Scripts".

  this plugin allows the following functionality :
    scripts in header will load inside of the head tag
    scripts in footer will load before closing the body tag

  to install this plugin :
    login to wordpress site
    go to plugins > add new
    search for 'header and footer scripts'
    click 'install now' and activate the plugin

  to use the plugin :
    save custom javascript code into a file with the .js format
    upload it into your site to this folder : wp-content/themes/<name_of_theme>/js/
    go to settings > header and footer scripts

  syntax example :
    <script src="http://www.yoursite.any/wp-content/themes/your-theme/js/file.js"></script>

  alternatively, avoid using a file by injecting javascript directly into the 'sripts in header' text input field :
    <script>
      let drink_coffee = (blend_preference) => sip(blend_preference)
    </script>

  to add custom scripts and stytles to wordpress, we'll create a function that will enqueue all of the scripts and styles.

  when enqueuing a script or stylesheet, wordpress creates a handle and path to find your file and dependencies it may have and then you will use a hook that will insert your scripts and stylesheets

  enqueueing scripts and stylesheets :

    the proper way to add scripts and styles to your theme is to enqueue tthem in the functions.php files. the style.css file is required in all themes, but it may be necessary to add other files to extend teh functionality of the theme

    note, wordpress includes a number of javascript files as part of the software package, including commonly used libraries such as jquery. before adding your own javascript, check to see if you can maske use of an included library

  the basics :
    1. enqueue the script or style using ->
      wp_enqueue_script()
        or
      wp_enqueue_style()

  style sheets :
    the css style sheets are used to customize the presentation fo your theme. A stylesheet is also the file where information about your theme is stored. for this reason, the style.css file is required in every theme.

    rather than loading the stylesheet in your header.php file, you should load it in using wp_enqueue_style. in order to load your main stylesheet, you can enqueue it in functions.php

    to enqueue style.css :
      wp_enqueue_style('style', get_style_uri());

      // this will look for a stylesheet name 'style' and load it

      // the basic function for enqueueing a style is ->
      wp_enqueue_style($handle, $src, $deps, $ver, $media)

      you can include these parameters :
        $handle, name of the stylesheet
        $src, location of the stylesheet (path?)
        $deps, whether or not the stylesheet depends on another stylesheet. if it is set, this stylesheet will not be loaded unless its dependent on stylesheet is loaded first
        $ver, sets the version number
        $media, can specify which type of media to load this stylesheet in, such as 'all', 'screen', 'print', or 'handheld'

      load a stylesheet named 'slider.css' in a folder named 'css' in theme's root directory, use :
        wp_enqueue_style('slider', get_template_directory_uri() . '/css/slider/css', false, '1.1', 'all')

  scripts :
    any additional javascript files required by a theme should be loaded using wp_enqueue_script. this ensures proper loading and caching, and allows the use of conditional tags to target specific pages. these are optional

    enqueue a script :
      wp_enqueue_script($handle, $src, $deps, $ver, $in_footer)

      @params = {
        $handle : 'name of the script',
        $src : 'location of the script',
        $deps : 'array that can handle any script that new script depends on, ex->jquery',
        $ver : 'list a version number',
        $in_footer : 'boolean whether script is in footer rather than the header -> this is useful for avoiding the delay of loading the DOM tree'
      }

    enqueue function ex :
      wp_enqueue_script('script', get_template_directory_uri() . '/js/scripts.js', array('jquery'), 1.1, true)
