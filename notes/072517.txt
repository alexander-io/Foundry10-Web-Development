Another productive day in the office. In this paragraph I'll provide a brief list of features that were implemented today, then I'll use rest of the space in the document to give a step-by-step account of modifications/additions.

  0. modified the data model so to associate two "articles" with each of the program areas

  1. research article/program/brief content on foundry10.org and c&p titles, sub-titles, text-bodies, and links

  2. for each of the articles, apply their corresponding data points in the model

  3. bind the data from the model to the window (DOM) on mouse click for a particular category

  4. constrain the dimensions of the photographs in the info-window module (now the images are looking closer to their intended dimensions in the window)

  5. modify the arrow-scroll-navigation-button so to scroll through the page content on click

  6. create a truncate() function to solve the issue of text-overflow from the articles (the function is noted below)

  7. update text in info-banner, instead of "redefining education through <insert_area>" use "foundry10 is redefining education through <insert_area>"

create data model for articles, replace two link structure in articles with double link, re-work footer to remove areas links

info banner, added more content to articles data model including sub-title, icons and links

merge data models for articles and categories, this allows easy access to the articles that are child elements of each category, also create a truncation function that shortens text based on the number of words and the number of letters -> this is useful for managing overflow of text in the article cards

  note, the truncation function turned out to be an elegeant implementation, so i'll include a function prototype below :

```javascript
let truncate = function(str, num_words) {
  let text_words = str.split(' '), builder = '', i = 0

  // for every wod in the string
  for (word in text_words) {

    // are we at the word limit?
    if (i>=num_words) {
      // check number of characters
      builder = if_lengthy_string_remove_word(builder, num_words*4)
      // concat the ellipses to the string
      builder += '...'
      return builder
    }
    builder += ' ' + text_words[word]
    i++
  }
  return builder
}

// recursively remove extra length from the string until it is within range
let if_lengthy_string_remove_word = function(str, num_chars) {
  let arr = []
  if (str.length > num_chars) {
    arr = str.split(' ')
    arr.pop()
    if_lengthy_string_remove_word(arr.join(' '))
  }
  return str
}

```

fix typo in data model which prevented access of artistic_design articles

for the article cards, fix the size by setting a max/min-height, create an icon_path map which relates (wrench|gears|brick|programmer|controller|display|book|brush) icons with the relative path to the image in the file system

size constraints on articles, truncate sub-title links, bind icons for each click on category

set up initial state of articles so not to include dummy text

modify and capitalize sub-title links

modify banner-header text, now 'foundry10 is redefining education through <insert_category>'

fix the size of the image element in the info banner (now the dimensions are much better and each image is displayed more clearly), for the down arrow controller element, assign scroll targets to infobanner and footer of page, when scroll value is at bottom of page, replace the down arrow icon with an up arrow icon; on click at bottom of page, scroll to top of page

pull functionality of arrow scroll element from the index.html and place it in js/arrow_scroll.js

move animation_loop javascript to self contained file, remove extraneous comments, condense styles

modify hiphop image so that it has more appropriate dimensions for the space that contains it


I spent much time today expanding the data model so to include an array of articles for each category, here's the model :

Each was led by classroom teachers with an interest in Legos and each developed their own club curricula and projects. All Lego building kits and robotics kids were donated as part of the after school project with foundry10. We also supplied stipends for the teachers to run the clubs. The goal was to provide opportunities, free of charge, for students to build, explore, and be creative in an after-school setting.

Often, however, schools come in on the tail-end of an emerging technology, thereby limiting students’ opportunities for exposure and skill development. Advanced technology can be considered a type of cultural capital which students can utilize in order to progress and navigate future career pathways. Virtual reality is one such advanced technology, now readily commercially available, which is making its way into classrooms. Our recent research focusing on the implementation of VR in classrooms provides information about how educators can make VR accessible to students. Access in virtually reality can be considered through multiple lenses and we discuss a few of them here. The first considers learning styles and nontraditional engagement, the second discusses access to a global education, and the third revolves around issues of social justice. We feel these areas are highly relevant considerations for educators as they consider the use of virtual reality.',

Through easily accessible programs such as Scratch and Gamemaker, students from early elementary up through college are creating games and learning while doing it. We gathered surveys from 107 game design and development professionals and 300 middle school students, before and after a game development class, about the value of teaching game development in a middle school class. Then we compared the responses of the 7th- and 8th-graders with what the game developers said they felt would be important about making games. We hope this information will help teachers who are constructing game development classes, and show the broader view of the value inherent in game development that professional game makers can provide.',
