Research Dark Site Styling Dos and Don'ts

  use more white space (or should it be called black space?)
  dark designsd have a tendency to feel "heavy", and cluttering them up can reinforce that feeling

  textual white space
    because readability is a high concern for dark-themes, pay close attention to the text itself
    one way to improve readability through the text on the page is to increase the white space by adjusting paragraph size, kerning size, and leadning size
    another way to increase readability is to increase font size

  text contrast
    pay specific attention to the contrast of the text
    in the same way that viewing a bright light in a dark room is harsh on the eyes, reading pure-white text on a black back ground may also be harsh
    below is a key with differing hex colors combinations of backs and whites for backgrounds and matching fonts. They are "pleasing" to the eye. The outer hex value represents the black-ish background color and the inner hex values represent the white-ish font color
      #background-color
        #font-color

      #000
        #cccccc
        #bbbbbb
      #111
        #dddddd
        #cccccc
        #bbbbbb
      #222
        #eeeeee
        #dddddd
        #cccccc
      #333
        #ffffff
