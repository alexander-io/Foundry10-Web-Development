This morning I met with Lisa to briefly discuss the issue I've been having accesssing the foundry10 mail server. I messaged Tom about the issue!

Today I have set out to refine the navigation bar (more...). One of the current issues with the navigation bar is its readability. In my opinion, the font size for the link-titles in the navigation bar are small. For a solution, I'll apply a few style updates to the link-titles, first I'll increase the font size. Next I'll update the color and opacity. Next I'll update the letter kerning and spacing. 

Currently there are two  usability issues with the navigation bar. First is that each drop-down menu will stay 'revealed' or 'open' while there's another active drop-down. This feels clunky -> I'd prefer to see only one drop-down menu item able to be viewed at one time. The second issue is especially pronounced when using the site on a mobile device. It's a common gesture on a mobile device to remove pop-ups (including drop-down menu items), by clicking away fromm the menu. This is not currently a feature. In order to implement this, I'll select the body element of the Document-Object-Model add a 'click' event listener to it. On 'click event', close all drop-down menus.
