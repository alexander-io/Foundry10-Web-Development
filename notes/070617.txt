This morning I met with Lisa to briefly discuss the issue I've been having accesssing the foundry10 mail server. I messaged Tom about the issue!

Today I have set out to refine the navigation bar (more...). One of the current issues with the navigation bar is its readability. In my opinion, the font size for the link-titles in the navigation bar are small. For a solution, I'll apply a few style updates to the link-titles, first I'll increase the font size. Next I'll update the color and opacity. Next I'll update the letter kerning and spacing. 

Currently there are two  usability issues with the navigation bar. First is that each drop-down menu will stay 'revealed' or 'open' while there's another active drop-down. This feels clunky -> I'd prefer to see only one drop-down menu item able to be viewed at one time. The second issue is especially pronounced when using the site on a mobile device. It's a common gesture on a mobile device to remove pop-ups (including drop-down menu items), by clicking away fromm the menu. This is not currently a feature. In order to implement this, I'll select the body element of the Document-Object-Model add a 'click' event listener to it. On 'click event', close all drop-down menus. 

update 12:15pm, I have just updated the navigation bar to improive mobile usability. Here's the logic/pseudo-code that I used:

    For each click-event on the body of the webpage :
      if the mouse is not over a navigation-bar link and the mouse is not over the drop-down menu : 
        then close all drop-down menu items 

Below I'll include a code snippet describing the functionality that I've implemented
```javascript
// set booleans to track the state of the mouse's location
// this is useful for closing drop-down menus when mouse is both away from the nav-items and drop-down menus
let mouse_in_nav_item = false, mouse_in_drop_down = false 

// add event listeners to the nav-items and the drop-downs to update the booleans
// let n imply a nav-item, let d imply a drop-down menu
n.addEventListener('mouseover', function(){
  mouse_in_drop_down = true
})
n.addEventListener('mouseleave', function(){
  mouse_in_drop_down = false
})
d.addEventListener('mouseover', function(){
  mouse_in_drop_down = true
})
d.addEventListener('mouseleave', function(){
  mouse_in_drop_down = false
})
// finally, for each click on the document body,
//    if the mouse isn't over the nav-item or dropdown
//        then loop through and hide all drop-downs
body.addEventListener('click', function() {
	if (!mouse_in_drop_down && !mouse_in_nav_item) {
 		for (let i = 0; i < nav_lst.length; i++){
    		d.style.visibility = 'hidden'
    	}
  	}
});

```

update 12:40pm, I have just updated the navigation bar with an aforementioned correction to its functionlaity. The update that I made enforces a rule where only one drop-down menu can be visible at a time. This prevents the user from opening all drop-down menus at one time. In order to implement this, I've defined a function in the public/js/dropdown.js to hide all drop-down menus on function call. With this function in place, I simply call the hide_all_drop_down() function immediately before 'revealing' any of the drop down menu items. This enforces the rule allowing only one drop-down menu to be visible at one time. The function is captured in the following code snippet...

```javascript
let hide_all_drop_down = function(nav_lst) {
	for (let i = 0; i < nav_lst.length; i++){
		nav_lst[i][1].style.visibility = 'hidden'
	}
}
```

update 5:09pm, after sometime confusing myself over FTP, I posted to WordPress the July 7th post titled, 'Pre-K...', to the Early Education accordian. The post can be found here http://foundry10.org/areas-overview/early-education/. In addition to creating the post, I have updated the accordian to include the new post at the top of the widget, I moved the 'old' post to the '+ show more' section

I've been putting more work into the navigation bar, especially the 'Areas' section. The design as it stands feels 'cluttered' so I took all 12 of the areas and separated them out into 3 separate 'super-categories' : tech, education, and art. I'm using these 'super-categories' to guide/organize my progress on the nav bar.

he current nav-bar layout has 2 columns to house 12 items, it does this in no particular order. the current layout looks like this :

areas = [
	column_01 = [
		'artistic design',
		'digital audio',
		'early education', 
		'gender studies',
		'internships',
		'robotics'
	],
	column_02 = [
		'automotive', 
		'games and learning', 
		'drama', 
		'hip-hop', 
		'professional development',
		'virtual reality'
	]
]

the proposal re-design is this :

areas = [
	tech = [
		'artistic design',
		'digital audio',
		'early education', 
		'gender studies',
		'internships',
		'robotics'
	],
	education = [
		'automotive', 
		'games and learning', 
		'drama', 
		'hip-hop', 
		'professional development',
		'virtual reality'
	], 
	art = [
		'artistic design',
		'digital audio',
		'drama',
		'hip-hop'
	]
]

I took the proposal redesign nav-bar mock-up and notes and began implementing the 3-column navigation bar. The changes are live in the devlopment environment at opensail.io. Also, screen captured image of the navigation bar re-design is avilable in the project repository, at md_images/dropdown_0001.png.

In addition to taking notes here on my computer, I also take notes in my notebook. So to more clearly demonstrate my creative process, I have uploaded images of my note-book mock-ups and sketches to the project repository. These images can be found in the md_images/sketches directory. Or, alternatively you might like to visit the project repository and scroll to the bottom of the page -> where I have included embeded images of my sketches. Here's a link to the project repository https://github.com/alexander-io/Foundry10-Web-Development

I met with Andrun today. He is in the midst of learning about the document-object-model and is practicing his skill with manipulating a webpage. He has begun writing some basic html and css. So far he has implemented the shell of a navigation bar and seems to be progressing well. He seems to have very thoughtful and creative way of learning.

I began designing a graphic to provide a visual represenation of the on-goings at foundry10. The graphic will chiefly consist of one large & central sphere surrounded by three orbiting spheres. The central/large sphere will represent the core of foundry10, while the orbiting spheres represent the 'super-categories' of foundry10's areas -> tech, education, and art. I plan to include relevant icons in each of the orbiting spheres that indicate tech, education, and art respectively. I have sketches for this design available in my notebook, there is a digital mock-up (a .png file) of this design available in the project repository at the md_images/f10_070617.png.
