Today I'm setting out to primarily work toward two goals. First, make the expose page mobile friendly and friendly to screens that have non-standard aspect ratios. Next, program the info-banner display functionality.

On the mobile/aspect-ratio front, I've identified and fixed a HUGE issue in the code. Each of the elements in the DOM were having their y-axis values (offset from top of screen) set accordign ot percentages of the available screen area. This caused undesirable overlap of elements when viewed on non-standard aspect ratio monitors.
