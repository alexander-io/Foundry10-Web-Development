Today I've worked toward implementing a the mock-up that I created. I especially put work into the nav-bar and the landing display.

For the nav bar, I have added another layer to contain re-directing links. The bottom layer of the nav has links that trigger drop-down menus.

For the landing display, I implemented the 'triangular' backdrop following inspiration from what Tom mentioned about foundry10 being an 'against the grain oranization'.

I checked in with Andrun today. He seems to be making progress toward planning his project. I gave him a demonstration of localhost development.
